# React + TypeScript + Vite

# Light-It Challenge

This challenge is about a frontend application that enables users to manage patient data.

The app is made with React, TypeScript, Vite , Tailwind css and Shadcn/ui (components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS)

You can see it here: https://silver-pasca-38edf2.netlify.app/

## Configuration

If you want to run this app locally, you need at least Node 18 installed. Once you have cloned the repo and run `npm install` , just run `npm run dev` and you will see it in http://localhost:yourportofchoice

## Libraries/tools

- Tailwind css
- Shadcn/ui
- Formik
- Yup

The reason why I used Tailwind css and Shadcn/ui is because I have never used them before and I took advantage of this challenge to give it a try. Furthermore, I used Formik to manage in a fast and simple way the forms and Yup as validation form since is a tool which I feel comfortable with and I believe it's reliable.
